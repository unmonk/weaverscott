            Scott's mentorship was instrumental to starting my career as a
            software engineer. I've known Scott for many years, and I credit his
            guidance and encouragement with helping me finally make the leap to
            engineering. Be it through kind words and advice, or hopping
            directly on a call to help me troubleshoot a problem in my code, I
            have always been able to count on Scott. We shared some time at
            Olive, and even though he was not my direct manager, he always took
            time to help where he could. His patient and knowledgeable approach
            would be a boon to any team. Scott displayed outstanding skill in
            JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, and Python, all while being a natural
            leader and mentor. I recommend Scott for any role requiring strong
            technical ability and leadership.

            Scott is an incredible developer who showed leadership and skill on
            a project we worked on together. Scott always found time to help
            mentor and teach to the entire team. His work on JavaScript, C#, and
            SQL were top notch and helped our project meet our deliverables. I
            would highly recommend Scott for any company looking for a highly
            skilled Full Stack Engineer with leadership.
