Liberty Mutual RightTrack is a usage based insurance program that rewards safe drivers with lower insurance premiums. The app uses a smartphone or an OBD-II device to collect data on factors such as your speed, acceleration, braking, and time of day you drive, which is then used to calculate your insurance premium.

The app is available on both Android and iOS.
